# chat_firebase

This is a simple HTML and Javascript template to create a tiny chat program using the realtime database with Google Firebase.

First you have to 
1. Register at Google Firebase
2. Add a new app (which will be a project-id)
3. Go to the realtime database
4. Add a field called <b>chat</b> 
6. Copy the key and project-id
7. Past the key and project-id in the init-firebase.js javascript

From the little form it sends a message to the realtime database
